## 📖 About

RedM-Scene Helper is a small web app that takes plain text and turns it into structured scene output that can be used directly in RedM.  
It was built as an experiment in combining web development with AI-assisted tooling to support roleplay and development workflows.

The project also includes an item generator to help create consistent, RP-friendly items for scenes and interactions.
